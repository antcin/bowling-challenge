Bowling Challenge
=================

```
As a bowling player,
So that I can record my score during a game,
I want to be able to record my score on a scorecard.

As a bowling player,
So that I can enter my score correctly,
I want to be able to see the possible number of pins left.

As a bowling player,
So that I can see strikes (X) and spares (/) displayed in the correct form,
I want those symbols to replace numbers and be shown on my scorecards, when applicable.

As a bowling player,
So that the score is accurate,
I want to see the total of a frame only after strikes and spare bonuses have been calculated.

As a bowling player,
So that I can start a new game,
I want to be able to play again.
```
